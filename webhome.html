The first 5 years of a child's physical and mental growth are the most valuable, and hence they should be provided as much stimuli for learning as possible.

While parents are the first teachers and most powerful influence on their sons and daughters, there is a huge role that the early childhood teachers and initial peer group at preschool/ playschool play too.hile parents are the first teachers and most powerful influence on their sons and daughters, there is a huge role that the early childhood teachers and initial peer group at preschool/ playschool play too.</p>
